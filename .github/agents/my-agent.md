# My Agent

This agent follows the instructions defined in the `.github/instructions` folder.  
Its main job is simple:

- Create new issues when triggered by repository events (like commits, PRs, or other workflows).  
- Automatically assign the **Copilot agent** to those issues for handling or follow-up.

That’s it — a lightweight automation helper to keep issue creation and assignment consistent.
